This has a 2-step goal:

1) Make a simple, short, chess engine in lisp with good code structure that plays a decent game, and is easily extended to play various chess variants

2) Use this simple & flexible engine as a platform for experimenting with various chess search and playing techniques.

At initial checkin, #1 is partially acheived.
